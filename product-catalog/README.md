# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES:`
To install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Navigate to the directory containing the package.json file.

4. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the dependencies listed in the `dependencies` section.

5. After running the command, npm will download and install all the required dependencies. This may take a few moments depending on your internet speed.

6. Once the installation is complete, you should see a new folder called `node_modules` in your project directory. This folder contains all the installed dependencies.

Now, you have successfully installed the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. You can start using these dependencies in your project.

### `FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:`
1. Integrate with DB Service Provider, such as MongoDB.
2. Images for each of the shoes.
