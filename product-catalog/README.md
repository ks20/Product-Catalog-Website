# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### `INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES:`
To install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Navigate to the directory containing the package.json file.

4. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the dependencies listed in the `dependencies` section.

5. After running the command, npm will download and install all the required dependencies. This may take a few moments depending on your internet speed.

6. Once the installation is complete, you should see a new folder called `node_modules` in your project directory. This folder contains all the installed dependencies.

Now, you have successfully installed the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. You can start using these dependencies in your project.
